## Using Spotify's API:

### Main Idea: Outputs song for inputted mood
Incorporating Spotify's Web API, Spotipy, to list a song that match a user's mood. These categories are stored in a dictionary of moods with associated songs. These moods will be calculated using energy < float >, danceability < 0 or 1 >, and valence. These induvidual songs are then added to a playlist on a user's account.
 - Incorporates future uses as well: authenticating user's email to dev database with an auth page, adding multiple songs from the same mood to the playlist.
